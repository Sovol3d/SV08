# Notice

Sovol will NOT give you support if you modify ANY files on your printer. this includes tuning. before you email sovol for support you must follow the factory reset guide or Re-flash the EMMC.

> This is the official source code for Sovol SV08. The damage caused by modifying firmware also using the third party firmware will lose the 1 year warranty. If you need support, itâ€™s recommended to reflash the stock firmware before contacting sovol.

> Sovol doesnâ€™t provide tech help for help users to modify source code, but if you need us to add more functions, you are welcome to send us your suggestions via Facebook Messenger or email

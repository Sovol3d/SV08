# Introduction

SV08 is a flying gantry Core-XY printer with a print area of 350x350x345mm, also a derivative work based on Voron V2.4. 
It aims to provide an alternative solution for 3D printing enthusiasts who are eager to use Voron V2.4 but are hindered by high costs and learning barriers.
We comply with the open source regulations of Voron and Klipper, and make SV08 open source (including structure, hardware, and firmware) for users to DIY.

SV08 mostly featured with:
- Core-XY kinematic design
- 4 independent Z motors(flying gantry) for precise control
- Enhanced details with Klipper firmware
- Large printing volume of 350x350x345mm
- Smooth operation with all-axes linear rails
- Quick and hassle-free assembly in just 1 hour
- Open-source for customization and flexibility

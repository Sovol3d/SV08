# Contributing

If you have the ability and know your way around github a pull request is a lot easier for me to merge. however if you just have a vauge idea of what you want added please leave a comment in the form of a [discussion topic.](https://github.com/mon5termatt/SV08-Community/discussions)

# Notice

> This is the official source code for Sovol SV08. The damage caused by modifying firmware also using the third party firmware will lose the 1 year warranty. If you need support, it’s recommended to reflash the stock firmware before contacting sovol.
